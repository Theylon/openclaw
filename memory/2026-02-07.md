# 2026-02-07

## OpenClaw Full Audit (completed 2026-02-05, documented now)

### Agents Configured
- **demrezel** — main assistant (DM + group topic 1)
- **planner** — Telegram topic 38
- **skilllookup** — Telegram topic 26
- **missioncontrol** — Telegram topic 92

### Cron Jobs
1. `lighter-health-monitor` — **PROBLEM**: fires every 15s as a reminder, not a real monitor. Spams DM. Recommended: disable/replace with stateful check.
2. `Daily AM briefing` — 08:30 Sun-Thu (fixed from daily)
3. `Daily PM briefing` — 18:30 Sun-Thu (fixed from 17:30 daily)

### Voice Transcription
- whisper-cpp installed (`/usr/local/bin/whisper-cli`)
- Models: `ggml-tiny.bin` (74MB), `ggml-base.bin` (135MB) in `models/whisper-cpp/`
- Wrapper script: `skills/local/voice-transcribe/scripts/transcribe_whispercpp.sh`
- Config: `tools.media.audio.enabled=true`

### Secrets
- Trello: `/Users/eylonaviv/.openclaw/workspaces/demrezel/secrets/trello.json` (gitignored)
- OpenAI keys in openclaw.json (image-gen, whisper-api)
- Notion token in openclaw.json
- **Note**: Trello token was pasted in chat — should rotate

### Lighter Health Monitor State
- DB: `~/.openclaw/workspace/lighter-bots/engine/state/state.sqlite`
- Alert state: `~/.openclaw/workspace/lighter-bots/engine/ops/alert_state.json`
- Last status: `stale` since 2026-02-04

### Pending Decisions (from audit)
- [ ] Disable spammy lighter-health-monitor cron
- [ ] Implement real stateful health monitor (alert on transitions only)
- [ ] Decide if skilllookup (topic 26) and missioncontrol (topic 92) are needed
- [ ] Rotate Trello token

## Model Change Request
