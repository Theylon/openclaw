## Durable notes

- Facebook rental workflow in Telegram topic `-1003557311101` / thread `270` is actively used for manual runs and listing delivery.
- User preference clarified: **do not post/comment on Facebook**; only bring filtered relevant listings into Telegram so they can contact directly.
- Operational setup requested by user:
  - Enable heartbeats (for due-job checks)
  - Set `fb-rent-scout` cron cadence to every **120 minutes**.
- Typical command profile being used for manual scout runs:
  - `MIN_PRICE=5000`, `MAX_PRICE=9500`, `MAX_POST_AGE_MIN=90`
  - Three Facebook group URLs with `sorting_setting=CHRONOLOGICAL`.
- In practice, many extracted items come as `noText`; matches usually come from group `2065942027026008`.
