- User clarified expectation for scheduled AM/PM briefings: do the actual work (check calendar + Trello, send actionable overview), not just relay reminder text.
- User asked if assistant has Gmail access; confirmed Google Workspace tooling access.
- User asked to add flight itinerary (from image) to calendar; created 3 calendar events and invited `eylon@collider.vc`, with times set in local time zones (Israel / New York / Las Vegas) as requested.
- Trello workflow expectation from user: assistant should ask which "today" tasks are done and then move confirmed tasks to Done.
- Current Trello board state observed on "Eylon's Work": only `inbox` list visible with 6 cards (no explicit Today list/label found at time of check).
