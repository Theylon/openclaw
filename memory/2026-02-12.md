## OpenAI Agent Best Practices Review

Read OpenAI's blog post on building long-running agents: https://developers.openai.com/blog/skills-shell-tips

**Three key primitives:**
1. **Skills** — reusable SKILL.md manifests with routing logic
2. **Shell** — container execution for real work
3. **Compaction** — auto-compress context for long runs

**10 Tips Summary:**
1. Write skill descriptions as routing logic ("use when / don't use when")
2. Add negative examples to reduce misfires
3. Put templates inside skills (free when unused)
4. Design for long runs early (container reuse, compaction)
5. Explicitly invoke skills when you need determinism
6. Skills + networking = high-risk, use containment
7. Standard artifact directory for handoffs
8. Two-layer allowlists (org-level + request-level)
9. Use domain_secrets for authenticated calls
10. Same APIs local and cloud

## Improvement Plan Created

**Phase 1: Skill Quality**
- Rewrite skill descriptions with "use when / don't use when" blocks
- Add negative examples to high-traffic skills
- Move templates into skills

**Phase 2: Workspace Structure**
- Create `artifacts/` directory as standard handoff boundary
- Update AGENTS.md with artifact conventions

**Phase 3: Security Hardening**
- Enhance SHIELD.md with network allowlist rules
- Audit domain_secrets usage

**Phase 4: Long-Run Resilience**
- Document compaction strategy in AGENTS.md
- Create deterministic skill contracts for recurring workflows

## Activity Feed Status

Built and documented in memory/2026-02-07-activity-feed.md. API parses session transcripts, serves via localhost:8742. UI has filters for type, status, agent, tool.

To run:
```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspaces/demrezel/activity-feed
npx tsx parse-transcripts.ts --serve 8742
open index.html
```
