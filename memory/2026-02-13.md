## Durable updates

- Successfully pushed this workspace to public GitHub repo: `https://github.com/Theylon/openclaw` (branch `main`).
- Repo push initially failed due to GitHub auth/permission mismatch (`demerzelon` lacked access), then succeeded after access was granted.
- GitHub rejected first push because repo history contained oversized blobs (`models/whisper-cpp/ggml-base.bin`, `models/whisper-cpp/ggml-tiny.bin`).
- Resolved by rewriting git history to remove those model binaries, running GC, then force-pushing `main`.
- Secret-pattern scan on tracked files returned no matches before final push.

## Notes

- If large model assets are needed later, store via release artifacts/LFS/external storage instead of git history.
